was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb, in the shape of an <i><b>"L"​</b></i> on her
forehead... Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming, fed to the rules and I hit the
ground running. Didn't make sense not to live for fun, your brain gets smart but your head gets
dumb. So much to do, so much to see, so what's wrong with taking the back streets? You'll
never know if you don't go, you'll never shine if you don't <u>glow</u>...

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play. Hey now, you're a rock star, get the
show on, get paid. And all that glitters is gold, only <u>shooting stars</u> break the <i><b>mold</b></i>.”</p>
