the 1st article of the mexican constitution states that any fugitive slave that enters mexican soil is automatically free whether he is a mexican citizen or not and is fully protected by the law


edit thank you all for the awards

the audacity of being angry that your slave escaped

you know the more i find out about slavery the less i like it

mexico
more like mexibro
isnt that part of why jackson essentially stole florida from spain
a bunch of slaves from alabama georgia and the carolinas escape to florida where they werent slaves as long as they were self proclaimed catholics
vicente guerrero the president at the time  was also afromexican
what a thing to ask of him
ignorance in our government runs deeeep 
is there a reason history classes focus on slaves escaping to canada but dont mention them escaping to mexico

the westward expansion the war with mexico a lot of that was about cutting off avenues of escape for slaves

some relevant old writings of mine on escaping enslavement by heading to mexico



the vast majority of flights for freedom were from the upper south where the enslaved persons were imprisoned within a a not unreasonable distance to the north
if you consider some of the most famous people who were born in bondage they mostly originated there
harriet tubman was owned by a maryland enslaver as was frederick douglass
slipping north was the only real viable option for them while traversing the entire south would have been entirely out of the question except in the most exceptional circumstances and speaks to the general plight of those persons enslaved in the deep south who simply had no opportunity
the famed flight of ellen and william craft illustrates just how tough it could be their successful escape from a georgia plantation being possible only because ellen a lightskinned woman who would have been a quadroon in the racial parlance of the time was able to successful pass as a white man and her husband as her slave for the train journey northward essentially traveling in the open the one way to beat the odds of traversing such a large swathe of country populated by a hostile population and slave patrols looking for any slave without a pass


so in short you have enslaved persons from the upper south with no logical alternative and those in the deep south often with little chance of escape no matter what  many who did in fact wouldnt head north or to mexico but rather would settledown in the large nearly impenetrable swamps that characterized much of the region carving out a free existence as a small enclave within the slave south
but for those in texas
well it is the upper south in reverse mexico of course was where they were headed
as you note slavery was illegal there  the desire to ensure its security being a key reason texas broke away  and this made it an obvious destination for any enslaved person attempting to find freedom


it was enough of a problem for the laws of texas to reflect the threat posed by the border to the institution of slavery
texas has several laws in place that dealt with the apprehension of those seeking their freedom but included extra enticement for those close to attaining it as an 1844 state law entitled anyone who caught an escaped slaves west of the san antonio river to a fiftydollar reward for each plus two dollars for every thirty miles traveled to return them to the rightful owner
this was bolstered in 1858 law allowing the person who captured a slave escaping to mexico to be paid 13 of their value by the travis county sheriff who would in turn be repaid the amount by the owner or by resale of the person
although an act to encourage reclamation of slaves escaping beyond the limits of the slave territories of the united states didnt explicitly do so as it couldnt openly challenge mexican sovereignty the law was well understood to be offering enough financial encouragement to potential slavecatchers that they would be willing to risk going south of the border for their quarry


the latter law especially was a clear reaction to the opinions of texans as regarded their neighbors to the south as the mexican government of course did nothing to return escapees and texans felt that many mexicans were sympathetic and assisted those who fled which was bad enough but for those who remained in texas such things could stand to stir up among our servants a spirit of insubordination
 the inducement of escape also was feared to be fuel to the ever present terror of servile insurrection
an 1856 series of newspaper articles claimed to have uncovered a plot in colorado county by a group of slaves to murder most of the whites and flee south to mexico dragging along the young white women as captives for obvious but only insinuated purposes
although there likely was some group of slaves planning to flee their prison camp claims were made of intricate organization that would make a mason proud and there is little evidence beyond the writers imaginations that a mass group of slaves was

organized into companies of various sizes had adopted secret signs and passwords sworn never to divulge the plot under the penalty of death and had elected captains and subordinate officers to command the respective companies


of course truth is beyond the point though and what mattered was the impact on the white population
conventions such as that held in gonzales county in 1854 were held to discuss the issue the organizers there declaring

the escape of our slaves into mexico by the help of mexicans and otherwise has become a matter of magnitude and of sufficient importance to demand some decided action on the part of the people of western texas


in total we cant put a precise number on how many chose the path of freedom via mexico but certainly it numbered in the thousands
even in texas though in the northern part of the state mexico wasnt a guarantee and some chose to make their bid by aiming for indian territory modern oklahoma or further north to find sympathetic abolitionists in kansas but what records we do have would show them to be the minority
mexico was the best option and the choice for most texas escapees
but to tie back into your question it was an option for few others
it was a tough enough journey through the texas wilderness such as for the group of 25 enslaved persons from bastrop who requisitioned horses in 1845 and made their dash but the odds of even reaching texas let alone mexico from mississippi or alabama let alone the upper south was far too slim and whatever the appeal it might offer for freedom simply wouldnt outweigh the practical realities of affecting escape in the first place

the only solution is to build a border wall and make mexico pay for it

are there any interesting stories of escaped slaves who made a life for themselves in mexico

chingon

yup and mexicos second president vicente guerrero abolish slavery before the us did

whats the mexican equivalent of chad

the title of the post does a great job on its own in stating how much early america relied on and reveled in the subjugation of human beings based on skin color
the article ups the ante

mexico abolished slavery in 1829 when texas was still part of the country in part prompting white slaveholding immigrants to fight for independence in the texas revolution
once they formed the republic of texas in 1836 they made slavery legal again and it continued to be legal when texas joined the u
s
as a state in 1845

makes me wonder why mexico doesnt have a larger black population still
even along the caribbean coast like many central american countries do

unlike the us mexico has had a number of constitutional documents and also unlike the us every single one of them has declared that slavery is illegal

and i quote

 the constitution of 1843 in mexico preserved a good part of the legislative achievements promoted by the liberals among others the abolition of slavery freedom of the press and of opinion personal security and the inviolability of property and domicile
the constitution of 43 says no one is a slave in the territory of the nation and whoever is introduced will be considered in the free class remaining under the protection of the laws
this same principle was embodied in the constitutions of 1857 and 1917
the one of february 5 1857 states in its article 2 in the republic everyone is born free
the slaves who set foot on the national territory regain their freedom by that fact alone and have the right to the protection of the laws
and that of february 5 1917 article 2 slavery is prohibited in the united mexican states
the foreign slaves who enter the national territory will achieve their freedom and protection of the laws by this fact alone

source

mexican constitutions
so mexico is the land of the free

viva mxico 

they taught this to us in mexico when i lived there so you could imagine my surprise when i moved to the states and black people were just as racist as white ppl towards us
smh
so even those  bad hombres knew that slavery was fucked up
s

mexico had a black president waaaaaayyyyy before the us did
another til

slavery was a primary factor in texas declaring independence from mexico since mexico had abolished slavery shortly after achieving independence from spain


editing to add a source 

lots of folks want to downplay the role that slavery played

that is why afro mexicans exist
we also have a lot of chinese and japanese descendants living in mexico 
i remember the same thing happened with florida when it belonged to spain


spain said all are equal in the creators eyes


now heretics
well not our proudest moment

is that why the u
s
took half of mexico

mexico has a similar racial diversity to the us
when a regular american thinks mexican as a genetic racial group they think what is really mestizo which is the mixed heritage of european settlers slash conquerors and native americans but that is neither the only race in the country nor does it comprise the hispanic ethnicity of native spanish speakers in its entirety
the us counted hispanic as white for most of its history which is why surveys of racial data now refer to nonwhite hispanic or some variation


mexicos welcome of escaped slaves is in large part a major contributing factor
its demographics largely map to the us between black white mestizo etc when you dont count speaks spanish natively as a racial group


it doesnt help that every american representation of mexico is a country perpetually in sepia tone occupied entirely by various clones of danny trejo

its like with spain
spain let them be free but they did have to convert to catholicism and serve in the military during their war

edit i hope people arent thinking im defending spain
i was simply talking about something that reminded me about the above
i very much disagree with spain and what they did
viva mexico

viva los san patricios

heres an ingesting fact
the reason the battle at the alamo happened was because a bunch of white slave owners didnt want to give up their slaves when they moved to texas which at the time was still part of mexico

when texas decided to fight for independence from mexico one of the biggest factors was that mexico did not let them have slaves

invest in mexicoin
thats pretty much why texas is a state
white people settled in mexican land and wanted to own slaves and mexico wasnt having it

and here i thought i lived in the land of the free

texas the only state to secede in favor of slavery twice

so mexico was more about freedom than america who wouldve thunk

most mexicans are descendants of native peoples and the spanish who conquered them

mexico was a free country before the u
s
and accepted american immigrants
nice

i think ill be mexican now
well yeah
what did yall think the whole alamo battle was about

til another reason the gop hates mexico
based mexico

by the early 19th century slavery was already considered widely abhorrent
america was considered fairly backwards and barbaric for continuing to allow it

in bolivia there is a small city named coroico
many of the residents are the descendants of escaped slaves


i had no idea of this when i was there 20 years ago and it was a delight seeing darkskinned women wearing traditional bolivian full skirted dresses and a tiny fedora on their head


that day i learned

if this is really news to you i suggest you read up on the history of texas and the real history behind the alamo
the story that loves to get romanticized was actually just white people fighting to keep their slaves since texas was mexican territory at the time they were legit just enforcing their own laws but the story somehow becomes texans fighting for independence rather than illegal squatters refuse to give up slaves
mexico said fuck you your racist pod

we have a lot of potential in paper here in mexico
but after living here for about 33 years im pretty sure that the worst enemy of a mexican is another mexican


its like if it was in our nature to find all possible ways to fuck with the life of other nationals it almost feels like we thrive on this


and yet we can be so welcoming and friendly that many foreigners find in mexico true brothers


as a side note the mexican constitution recognizes that human rights belong to anyone who is in its territory without regarding its nationality race or creed

yay mexico

well you know


there was a whole bit about america taking texas and the mexican cession states


mexico was probably already really pissed
american natives were very welcoming to ex slaves as well

having irish american immigrant ancestors i was always taught to respect mexico st patrick battalion by david rovics
land of the free
yup its one of the reasons why texas rebelled
also fun fact sam houston wanted texas to be a free of slaves but texans werent having that so they booted him out of office

when my country became independent in 1818 we abolish slavery

always remember texas was founded by scumbag slavers who were traitors to 2 countries

i swear als robs you of a lot but never your sense of humor
my aunt used to call her alsrelated tremors the als shimmies and she would start dancing with it

following hawkings death in march 2018 bbc science correspondent pallab ghosh shared an anecdote of his first interview with the physics luminary at cambridge university in 2004


seeking to adjust his lighting the camera operator yanked a cable from a socket at which point an alarm sounded and hawking slumped forward as if unplugged from his life support
the anxious visitors rushed over to find hawking very much alive and giddy at his joke  the alarm was simply over the office computer losing its power supply


i can imagine for a moment that camera man saw his life flash before his eyes

if you cant find a reason to laugh about what life has handed to you it is hard to be happy

his interview with john oliver was hilarious


you once stated that there could be an infinite number of parallel universes so theoretically there could be a universe where im smarter than you


yes
and also a universe where youre funny
 

edit because people keep asking for the link heres the video 
steven hawking was notorious for his sense of humor and pranks
the guy thought it was funny to drive his wheelchair at high speed and run over the toes of people at the university he worked for


part of me wonders if there is an alternate reality out there where he lived a normal life without sickness and became a quick witted comedian

if it counts for anything i got to meet him at a dinner party once in the 90s and the first thing he said to me was to apologize for his american accent
that guy had an amazing sense of humor

stephen hawking on contact with alien life
if aliens visit us the outcome would be much as when columbus landed in america which didnt turn out well for the native americans

we only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldnt want to meet

i love this
hawking offered a compelling argument against the notion of destiny i have noticed that even people who claim everything is predetermined and that we can do nothing to change it look before they cross the road

i mean you cant be one of the smartest people in the world without being able to think on your feet
if you can openly and so grandly make fun of your own death then you can do anything
wouldve been legendary if he also did the windows log off sound

 
did his speaker just say

ha ha ha
ha ha ha
i am laughing
couldnt we wirelessly charge stephan hawking
a dude so smart you think he woulda figured it out smh

he could barely move his eyelids and cheek near the end of his life but when he really laughed at something it actually showed on his face
the laughter even though brief brought back some control of the muscles
laughter is very strong indeed it seems

ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha

imagine being stephen hawking and getting the chance to do some good ol physical comedy
brings a tear to me eye

theres a universe where that crew guy did kill hawking
i once saw someone in eso with the name walking talking stephen hawking and almost spit my drink on my monitor
thanks for coming to my ted talk

the same man that would absolutely deny the rumor that he ran over the toes of people he didnt like
he would then go on to say that if you dared repeat that rumor hed run you over

holy fucking shit can you imagine the awkward laughter after they realized he aint dead
classic
that cheeky bastard
how has noone mentioned the rumour that he would intentionally run over the feet of people he didnt like

when asked about it he said that is was
a malicious rumour ill run over anyone who repeats it

this dude was so smart even his pranks involve like three phases
lol
pallabcameraman
i shouldnt have done that

alarm ringing
i should not have done that

sees steve giggling
well listen here you little shit

in a interview once i dont remember who but it was a comedian
he asked hawking if there is a alternative world where he was smarter than hawking and he replied yesalso one where you are a funny

als may rob you of your mobility but it doesnt rob you of who you are
my grandma who had als made my mom cry the last time we visited her before she passed
gosh now im going to cry trying to recount it


we were heading out after our visit when my grandma alerted my grandpa that she had something to say
grandpa pulled out the see through spelling sheet and grandma stared at the letters slowly spelling out hat  behind  couch
my youngest sister had taken her hat off near the beginning of the visit and we were about to forget it on our way out


my mom sobbed on the way to the van
grandma may not have been able to move or speak but she was still the same grandma who used to bustle around the house taking care of everything and everyone


i miss my grandma
now i want an icecream sandwich

thats so cool
ive gotten a brief crick in a joint and bemoaned my situation
its so cool that he can do that

ha
ha
ha
ha

he was a jokester and he came up with his own dialogue for parts that he was on in the world of tv

this dude is one of my all time heroes
absolute legend

neenerneener  stephen hawking
the one thing as good as hawkings mind was his ability to find so much humour even at his own expense
its wonderful

so is there really no footage of the prank

im high af and havent stopped laughing at this for 5 min
what a legend

fun fact he was one of the people who turned up on the flight logs of jeff epsteins flights to his lolita island
hawking was savage af lmfao
guys dont froget he made a dick joke with popup blockers
i find that most people ive met with disabilities are the first ones to crack jokes about it
my deaf asl teacher in college was like that
she had a pile of anecdotes about her own deafness that she loved to share with her students

note that since hawking was not able to support his own weight he would not have slumped forward if he had actually died
im actually curious about how he was able to do this
i guess maybe his wheelchair had a function that caused the chair to tip forwards

camerman quoted as screaming plug him back in plug him back in
it made me giggle

my love for this man just increased by 200
cheeky bastard

he was a notorious troll and loved roasting people
he loved partying too when he was younger and more mobile

stephen hawking once told me i was the smartest man he had ever met
then he told me soul plane was the best movie hes ever seen


stephen hawking was a dick

i hope to learn how to be as grateful as stephen hawking
although he was given the gift of being a genius he was also given one of the hardest obstacles of life and yet he didnt just live in sorrow he continued being the same person and living with happiness and accepted his position in life
it is really admirable and i really hope i can teach myself that no matter what happens ill always be the same person and have a role in the world

so what did he say when they got to him


would it have been something like  ha ha ha youve been had in tts


this dude has been trolling us for years

gosh he was such a treaure

laughs in robotic tone  ha
ha
ha
ha

i mean stephen hawking while an insurmountable genius also had a really well documented sense of humor
i mean in a situation like his you probably develop that pretty quick

this is exactly onbrand hawking and while i did not know this i am not remotely surprised
this guy regularly sat in on the simpsons writing room and exchanged barbs with comedians for fun


plus when it comes to comedy in general disability is a potent superpower
it combines all the diplomatic immunity of old age with the classic minority move of pulling the rug out from under your audience whenever you damn well please
all you need then is a sharp mind and well yknow
hes stephen hawking

in star trek the next generation there was a scene where data was playing poker with various great minds on the holodeck
hawking was one of them and he played himself for the role
in the scene hawking won the hand being played
afterwards hawking would occasionally run into brent spiner and tell him that he is still waiting on his money for winning that hand

he always had a great yet morbid sense of humor
even was on the simpsons

hawking was so fucking cool
he adored being featured on futurama numerous times
he was apparently a wellknown prankster on cambridge


ok leaving his 1st wife wasnt that cool
but still

i remember when i was learning to drive stick i had stopped at the lights and rather than put the gear in neutral i had simply held the clutch down
i saw professor hawking crossing the road and excitedly pointed out to my instructor holy shit thats ste and took my foot off the clutch


luckily the handbrake was applied otherwise i might well have run over him

stephen hawking was crazy as fuck

ya been hawked

wish he was still here

vintage cyborg humor

ughhh i wish there was a video on that
10 pm
on a thursday madlad

absolute madlad

man had no shortages of daughters too

founders of big japanese companies preferred having daughters because they could choose their son in law that will take over their company

expand your empire to cover 16 of the world with this one simple hack


edit wow
my first sliver
thanks guys

the man wasnt stupid

definition of a winfucking win scenario

the son in law is an able commander you get multiple victories and a good heir to the throne

son in law is an idiot you get his kingdom and the daughter can just be married off to the next target
has there ever been a really good movie or series about genghis
i feel like theres a lot of untapped potential here
the habsburgs had a motto bella gerant alii tu felix austria nube  let others make war thou o happy austria make marriages


they expanded their borders and shrank their chins through marriages instead of war and managed to hang onto a throne for over 300 years

brutal but clever the man was a master of the long khan

you know who has more descendants than genghis khan

genghis khans dad

this is my chosen crusader kings 3 playstyle


honestly the more i play the less sense patriarchal inheritance makes tbh

genghis khan been playing ck2
lol kind of reminds me of that roman lawyer varus who married a powerful woman and thusly became a general and led the 16 17 and 18th legions to their death east of the river rhine in germany around 6 a
d


he had no business being in command of any army let alone 3 legions
but they probably figured he couldnt fuck it up
they didnt count on the cunning of arminius or arminiuss ability to succeed where all other had failed before him in uniting the barbaric germanic tribes together against a common enemy


awesome awesome short dramatic documentary on the above happenings here


seriously can not recommend that video or that youtube channel enough
have watched three of their videos so far the one on hannibal is freaking awesome too

uriah has entered the chat
now this guy knows how to play crusader kings
now thats genghsta
if he had the influence to just tell the allied king to join his army it sounds like already had the power there

damn thats fucking cold
rcrusaderkings called they want their til back
and that people is the kind of things you think of when youre genghis khan and your whole life is basically nonstop postnut clarity

machiavellian before machiavelli was a twinkle in his fathers eye

the khan instead of the prince

this dude killed so many people he lowered the temperature of the earth
anytime i see a mongol thread i must mention wrath of the khans series

dan carlins hardcore history podcast
wrath of the khans


its so fucking good

weird as hell seeing all these comments romanticizing genghis
his brutality and genocidal nature put hitler and stalin to shame when talking about eastern and central asia
he was by no means a good person and he was by no means a honorable fighter
i dare any of you guys to go to china or korea or even japan and say that genghis khan was a great ruler and tactician



edit wanted to clarify that he definitely does have the right to be called a great tactician i just meant to say that theres a lot of people who dont really agree he is someone worthy of reverence
his actions united mongolia for the better and established a long line of relative peace and stability but the man himself was at best a power hungry general and at worst a genocidal emperor

i wonder how long it will be before people talk about hitler like we are talking about genghis khan

how does a father in law hold more sway than a king

i get a little bit geghis khan
i want you getting it on
with rulers of these countries
those are the pros and khans
imagine thinking a guy who had fucking countless rape victims left in his wake was a feminist
thats whats known as a pro gamer move

dont hate the player hate the game
how kahnvenient

he also totally wrecked sporting goods store in san dimas with an aluminum bat when he time traveled to 1989

congratulations on marrying my daughter if you would please accept this humble gift of die
genghis khan the famous feminist known for raping thousands of women and leaving them to raise his children
if thats the standard you want to raise for men to be feminists im not sure youre right in the head

he was a smart motherfucker

dan carlins hardcore history podcast on the mongols is so fucking fantastic
i highly recommend it

khaaaaaaaaaaaaaan

thats very smart
so he basically played real life crusader kings 3

i mean
if he can order the king of a nation to go fight and die on the front lines i think he already has complete control

a khanning strategist indeed

ancient problems required ancient solutions
his daughter in law ended up having all 4 or her sons assume the mantel of khan



remarkable woman
although her sons ended up shattering the empire
theres a reason i dont go on hunting trips deep in the woods with my fatherinlaw

built a massive trade network
introduced europe to the black death

paved the way to global education
raped a lot of women
a lot of women

you surrender and youre liable to become an honourary mongolian and your ruler personally adopted into his household
you try to resist even a little
and every man woman child pet and livestock will be slaughtered your houses burned and your fields salted


an official cheated on his taxes so he had the coins he had stolen melted and poured down his throat
you wanted silver and so you shall have silver


man was a brutal savage devil
and a kind generous father to his people


worth remembering his name is temujin
gehnis khan is his title he never did anything by half the good and the bad
and thus history only remembers him as the great king
i didnt realise i copied my crusader kings strategy from genghis khan

so i dont have to worry about any of my stoner buds being undercover
what a relief was getting paranoid

they came to speak to the cs department at my college my freshman year
they begged everyone to stop smoking weed now so they could hire us when we graduated
and proceeded to say how many great cs people they had to let go for smoking

fbi do you smoke marijuana


hacker no just cocaine

fbi hes clean
we have had a few unofficial conversations at my work among middle management


they had talked about random testing and it was decided that was a really bad idea
we would lose 90 of the programmers and 75 of the field

i know i guy who is about as straight edge as anyone you could meet
he wanted to join the rcmp
he worked toward this goal for years volunteering at the police department getting in shape never doing anything remotely illegal


when they did his security check they found out his sister had a record for dealing a little weed  this was before legalization
they told him if he ever wanted to be a mountie he had to cut her out of his life
his sister


so they lost an applicant who would have been one of the good ones

as a federal employee i constantly hear how the fbi has the most archaic standards
a lot of federal law enforcement agencies have become too insular

be a lot cooler if they did

also they make them put their real names on their name badges instead of their awesome hacker names like zero cool crash override and acid burn

i was stationed at fort gordon for 3 years
i made friends with a lady that worked at honey pot down in the nsa dungeon
i had a ts clearance so she could at times give me some hints as to the problems they were encountering
well hiring was one of them
they wanted to conduct more offensive ops and work on better tools to exploit zerodays they had discovered in popular apps being used overseas
i think their primary function was nationstate cyber shit
she told me that 7090 of the people they wanted to hire could not qualify because they either smoked pot or had done it in the past few years
they also didnt like the antiquated and conservative dress codes etc


i told her the story of the russian dude that was able to garner nsa secrets a few years prior
i cant remember his name today but the dude was a 400pound pound potsmoking energy drinking gamer
smart as hell though
he could breach systems like no other without being detected and was able to take advantage of 34 zerodays whole teams at the nsa could not figure out
so russia hired him
he was actually ukrainian if i remember
i think this same guy did some damage to israeli and saudi intelligence and had others inside of russia helping him
i told her these are the guysgals they want
if you tell them they have to work 95 dress up and go into work not smoke potyoure are 100 fucked
this puts us at a huge disadvantage


i work in tech
and after i retired from the army and started working for a large firm
my mind was blown how many smoked some pot on a friday or over the weekend instead of drinking
it really changed my views on using it recreationally
even the ceo smoked it and this motherfucker was worth almost a billion dollars at the time
and here my dad is telling me hes a loser for smoking pot
im like that motherfucker is worth almost a billion dollars and has smoked pot his whole life
and hes a loser
you kidding me dad
  its people like my dad and old conservative views on the workforce that are slowly widdling away at any advantage we ever have
i know for a fact we are way behind in the cyber realm

marijuana
marijuana
 throws hat
i used to suck dick for coke
free your mind and the hacks will follow
i got interviewed by the fbi because a high school friend was getting a job with them
he cant tell us exactly what he does but his education is unimpressive decent college no honors and when we jokingly asked him to look into the jfk assasination for us he said he has the lowest level of access to classified info of anyone in the place


were not particularly close we didnt invite each other to our weddings
the fbi must have spent hundreds and hundreds of hours looking into this very very straight laced dude who by the looks of things earns like 80k


edit 80k is a very nice salary but it means hes probably pretty low level as fbi employees go
i cant imagine the clearance process for folks at the top of the bureau

til i cannot work at the fbi until may 14th 2023
the vast majority of tech savvy folks smoke pot from my experience in the industry
civilian tech jobs have all but ceased drug testing because of it


source am java developer am stoner
yeah thats a very minor part of why they struggle
the majority of their problem is pay and the hard degree requirements
they just dont pay competitively and the fbi unlike other three letter agencies has hard degree requirements
another issue is the mission
when i worked in the public sector i avoided the fbi after learning what the majority of the work was
its copyright enforcement and child porn the latter is the only noble imo part but its not something i personally want to do because i know people who have done it and it was scarring on them

most of the software people i know divide somewhat evenly between psychedelics and weed
with a little mixing in the middle


plus a sprinkling of cocaine and a near universal appreciation of adderall


but thats my personal take
ymmv

its almost like the government believes their own lies about pot

i can confidently say that we would lose at least 50 of my office up here in seattle if they drug tested people for pot
its just not worth it
who the fuck cares if employees get stoned and play video games in their off time
i cant wait until boomers get themselves and their antiquated ideas the fuck out of the way

with marijuana legalized in eight states and the district of columbia and medical marijuana legal in 30 states plus d
c
 youd think some of these arcane techniques would fall by the wayside but no
and it seems especially not in the fbi
nothing not a puff for three years
good luck fbi and good luck to us all

most likely a security clearance issue
ive heard stories about gs15s the high end of the civilian federal service pay scale losing their clearance for a shitload of unpaid parking fines because it shows a flagrant disregard for the law
marijuana is still federally illegal so theres no grey area officially
i think a lot of managers have a dont ask dont tell policy about this in legal states
dont ask questions you dont want answers to

still true to this day
the boston department has been looking for people for the past 10 years they send high up recruiters to large conferences too yet they still want to turn me away i cant help but approach them at every conference its hilarious to string them along just to make them send you away from some silly rule


its their loss
i have many friends with successful cybersecurity careers in the private sector who need marijuana to control other issues they may have whether physical or mental
and the fbi doesnt give 2 flying fucks if you are on opioids
you can really tell how in touch sarcasm with society and technology the fbi are

i hear thats how they weed out the applicants

i work for a consulting firm that writes software for a lot of fortune 1000 companies
many have started excluding marijuana from their list of disqualifying substances
they still test for it because the tests are not customizable  they look for a set list of 5 or 9 or 11 substances
but if you test positive they dont disqualify you


its not about them being ok with weed
its about how few tech professionals they would be able to work with given the states where weed is legal
theyd lose ca wa il ny and many more


the federal government is fucking itself with the sticks up their asses hobbling our technical capabilities as a country
smoking weed is like coffee for many people in tech

reminds me of something said by cybersecurity pioneer and insane person john mcafee
the fbi wanted apple to help them break into the iphone of a terrorist who committed the attack in san bernardio in 2015
some news outlet asked mcafee why the fbi couldnt break into the phone themselves and he said why do the best hackers on the planet not work for the fbi
because the fbi will not hire anyone with a 24inch purple mohawk 10gauge ear piercings and a tattooed face who demands to smoke weed while working and wont work for less than a halfmillion dollars a year
the reduced pay long hours being forced to wear a suit and rigid hierarchy where some political guy with no technical skills is your boss probably got rid of the rest of the applicants

perhaps they should update their rules together with the cia and nsa
make a joint effort so to speak

when your prime newhire candidates are people who are demonstrably smarter than you and smoke weed without issue its a pretty big ass indicator that criminalization has always been a giant crock of shit

im sure they have a private contracting firm they can use to get around some of these rules

i work in the background check industry most large companies are backing away from the standard 5 panel drug screening and are using a 4 panel minus marijuana
for larger companies it is becoming harder and harder to keep up with marijuana legalization

thats ironic seeing as how the government has the highest percentage of opioid abuse out of any other workforce demographic
thats just rich

lol reminds me that i was going to go to school for accounting and become an fbi agent but they required that you sign an affidavit that you have never smoked marijuana
it was around the time of enron

as a person who hiredfired many programmerssoftware people i did not care if they used marijuana in their spare time
but this was a very professional atmosphere and theres no way im hiring jeff spicoli who comes into the interview with a pot leaf tshirt no matter how good he is at his job
do what you want in your spare time but dont bring that culture into the office

apr 23 2018

i remember this
happened to me though not for a cs job but special agent
went to amsterdam had a brownie no longer eligible
i havent read through the other comments but this policy feels very throwing the baby out with the bath waterish

i work in it and i can confirm i smoke a bunch of weed
whenever i have to work on a programming project i smoke up put on some music and go to it
its a hell of a lot easier since ive been working from home for the past 2 months its a lot harder to smoke when im at work haha
what a ridiculous rule
a friend from law school framed his rejection letter from the rcmp canadian fbi which stated his refusal to give up marijuana disqualified him
they didnt care that he smoked previously but he had to agree to quit once hired


i believe they have now reversed their policy because they found it disqualified to many candidates


x200b

edit uafterburner corrected me
rcmp policy is now no use unless it is 28 days before your next dutyshift
so its essentially still prohibited for members to use
how would they know


would it be more accurate to say they require that applicants were not caught with marijuana during the last 3 years or is that wrong
im assuming they drug test when hiring but a urine test will only tell you if theyve smoked in the last month or so at most in most cases

they still make enough hackers work for the fbi through threats so i guess they dont really need to change that hiring rule

why dont they just create a back door then used a worm hole to breech the firewall
then they could edit the data base

i bet hoover was wearing a dress and makeup when he came up with that rule

cia recruitment is even stricter
i think you cant have had more than 3 instances ever
lots of mormons at the cia

the real reason is that the gs scale is laughably low for this profession

make stupid rules win stupid prices

edit good thing im not a cop pinned the wrong three letter agency


weird rule for coke dealers to have

col
shaw carried a famous sword when he led his men into his final battle and this was depicted in the film glory 1989
upon his death the extremely valuable sword was thought to have been stolen by a confederate soldier and likely sold
however it was discovered just last summer that one of his black soldiers was able to retrieve and return the sword to the shaw family where it was placed in an attic for over 150 years
the sword is now on display at the massachusetts historical society


story
gen patton wished to be buried with his men
he was buried in a luxembourg american cemetery with several thousand soldiers
his grave is plain and relatively undistinguished
here is a photo of pattons headstone shortly after his burial 

it has since been replaced with a stone headstone and moved a bit off to the side to accommodate all of the visitors

glory is a great movie about this

man that was a hard one to fit inside 300 characters


for a more verbose account colonel robert gould shaw was the commanding officer of the 54th massachusetts the first allblack regiment in us history
on july 18 1863 the regiment was ordered to spearhead an assault on fort wagner
shaw was killed during the initial charge as he led his men into battle


while the assault was initially successful union forces were eventually pushed back and confederate troops held on to the fort
common practice at the time was for fallen officers to be given an honorable burial regardless of the side they were on
however as shaw led the first allblack regiment commanding confederate general johnson hagood did not deem him worthy of that honor stating

had he been in command of white troops i should have given him an honorable burial as it is i shall bury him in the common trench with the niggers that fell with him


union troops tried to recover his body and give him a proper burial but were unsuccessful
hearing of this shaws father sent a letter to the regimental surgeon stating

we would not have his body removed from where it lies surrounded by his brave and devoted soldiers
we can imagine no holier place than that in which he lies among his brave and devoted followers nor wish for him better company
 what a bodyguard he has


and so the act considered by general hagood to be an insult came to be seen as the greatest honor that could have been bestowed upon shaw




the story of colonel robert gould shaw and the 54th massachusetts infantry regiment is memorialized in the film glory starring matthew broderick as shaw

the confederates thought it was an insult for col
shaw to be buried with black soldiers


shaws family were hardcore abolitionist leaving col
shaw with his men was his parents way of honoring him and his soldiers


i am 30 col
shaw was 25 years old when he died
leading a directsuicidal assult on a confederate fort which was never captured during the war
i cannot imagine leading a regiment into battle at that age
his papers are in a university somewhere in massachusetts
i believe
the papers are worth the read


very interesting guy

glory was a great movie which depicted this act at the very end

give em hell 54

but well never be truly free

until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me

you and i
do or die
wait till i sally in

on a stallion with the first black battalion

honestly its weirdly satisfying he was buried with his soldiers hed have an insane family bond with them and isnt that what we all want

witness him

200000 black soldiers joined the union army


around one out of six of grants men in the eastern theatre was black


most of them were born into slavery experienced all the cruelties of slavery were freed by the war then immediately joined the union army to finish off slavery


we can glorify shaw but remember that most of his men didnt have a childhood
they had barely lived a day in real peace and freedom

give em hell 54th

i actually already knew this because i had to do a report in sixth grade on a real person from the movie after watching glory and i had a crush on matthew brodericks character and other kids made fun of me for how old he was 27 at the time of the movie i mean yeah i was like 11 but who hasnt had a crush on him at some point


i think they did him a service by burying him with his men
he probably would have liked that
the original site washed away sometime after the bodies or what they could find of them were moved by the military
the whole fort is gone now

johnson hagood was the confederate general that was tasked with returning union generals bodies so they could be properly buried but didnt do so for shaw because he led black soldiers


hagood said

had he been in command of white troops i should have given him an honorable burial as it is i shall bury him in the common trench with the niggers that fell with him


hagood was honoured after his death by having a town in south carolina named after him the johnson hagood stadium in raleigh and many streets in south carolina
good job south carolina

i love how people try to say the confederate is not about white supremacy
and he was also only 25 when he died
thats a young man with so much responsibility and with so much to lose
much respect to the young colonial
a true american treasure and patriot

lets insult somebody by putting them to rest with their comrades

racist logic
this guy needs a memorial in every state

sometimes i really hate being from the south
i dont doubt that there were good hearted virtuous southerners back in the day but dammit stuff like this just makes me sad to know how backward and wrong the south was back then and still is in many parts
and the confederate leader who led the defense of fort wagner where shaw was killed became the governor of south carolina after the war
no punishment for being on the losing side of the war instead a promotion


good old reconstruction
the union wins the war but the south wins the peace
one of the most important time periods in the history of the united states specifically for its failures to ensure equal rights for all after the civil war

hes actually a great great great uncle of mine

ti already knew confederates were racist assholes

glory is a fantastic film


its always a good reminder that racists lost then and have continued to lose throughout history
when we turn on the news and see all of the awful people making us think otherwise we have to remember that they have done nothing but lose since the civil war

the fact that people still proudly wave that flag makes me sick

glory
worth a look

kinda wish wed get a game of thrones styled show that was about our civil war


show the complexity and morally muddled characters on both sides


show the pre war free state slave state politics the siege of atlanta
show the totality and brutality of war racism


all while trying to be firm and level unbiased and true to the history
with an overall tone that war never changes that people never change


i can picture a horrifying image of black corpses and a single white corpse stretched out on top as the camera slowly pulls out as confederates drop more black bodies in all while the sounds of horses canon fire drown out the screams and yelling

when your father who was born in the 1800 is not even a little racist but in 2018 we give the excuse oh but he grew up in a different time
for all these people who seem to think that the civil war was not fought on the basis of keeping black people enslaved i encourage you to take a look at the cornerstone speech  alexander stephens the vice president of the confederacy


the new constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to ourpeculiar institutionsafrican slavery as it exists among usthe proper status of the negro in our form of civilization
this was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution
jefferson in his forecast had anticipated this as the rock upon which the old union would split
 he was right
what was conjecture with him is now a realized fact
but whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands may be doubted
the prevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old constitution were that the enslavement of the african was in violation of the laws of nature that it was wrong in principle socially morally and politically
it was an evil they knew not well how to deal with but the general opinion of the men of that day was that somehow or other in the order of providence the institution would be evanescent and pass away
those ideas however were fundamentally wrong
they rested upon the assumption of the equality of races
this was an error
it was a sandy foundation and the idea of a government built upon itwhen the storm came and the wind blew it fell
 

our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas its foundations are laid its cornerstone rests upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition
this our new government is the first in the history of the world based upon this great physical philosophical and moral truth
this truth has been slow in the process of its development like all other truths in the various departments of science


reminder the confederates were the bad guys of the american civil war

american union troops tried to recover his body but his father sent a letter saying we would not have his body removed from where it lies surrounded by his brave and devoted soldiers


lets not forget who was what here

fucking beautiful
 
fuck the confederacy and its modern day apologists

get killed leading troops in battle


confederates bury you with your black soldiers because they think its an insult


civil war was totally about states rights lol



bull
fucking
shit

but the civil war wasnt fought over slavery or skin colour
a damn admirable man
the moment people stop dividing by races a lot of things will work it self out

tldr  ferris beuller was put in a mass grave w god and that asshole from training day as well as the rest of his soldiers

had he been in command of white troops i should have given him an honorable burial as it is i shall bury him in the common trench with the niggers that fell with him


sadly an attitude that persists

such classy people the confederates
spit
im a simple man
i see col
shaw i upvote

this is why people who say that theyre proud of their confederate heritage probably dont know anything about it
who would be proud of this

youre just now learning this
glory should be a mandatory film for all americans

humans are cunts

well bury him with the men he fought alongside
and theyre black tehe
 thatll show him


racism and brain cells seem to have a close link
